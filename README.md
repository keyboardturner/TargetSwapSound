# TargetSwapSound
Because sometimes some unit frame addons (unintentionally) remove the targetting / deselect sounds.

Very simple script for playing the target selection sound and deselecting a target. Many unit frame addons will (unintentionally) lose this sound as a result of replacing the target unit frame. All this does is bring if back. If you play without an addon that skins the target unit frame, you probably won't see any difference.

Should work in all versions of the game including Dragonflight.
